In the mid-1870s and early 1880s the national economy took a downturn, increasingly leading white workers to view the Chinese as threats to the few available jobs. In 1882 the federal government passed Chinese Exclusion Act, prohibiting all Chinese labor immigration for ten years. By the mid-1880s anti-Chinese sentiment had spread across the West. City leaders in Seattle began to advocate an orderly and legal-supported expulsion of the local Chinese, but not everyone agreed. On February 7, 1886, violence broke out as a mob began to forcibly eject most of the city\'s Chinese population. At least one person was killed when the mob attacked the Home Guards protecting Chinese residents. Martial law was declared and federal troops remained in Seattle until summer. Although the white population of Seattle quickly moved past these events, it would be 20 years for the Chinese population in Seattle to return to its numbers before the riots. The newspaper pictured here, The Seattle Daily Post-Intelligencer, continues to serve the city as of 2019, although since 2009 as an online-only publication. An article featured in this issue of The Seattle Daily Post-Intelligencer, titled ""Martial Law: Its Effect in Seattle,"" outlines the extent of martial law in the city, an additional call for volunteers, and an update of the wounded men\'s conditions at the hospital, including the information that Charles G. Stewart had died on Tuesday morning. The article ends with ""Notes"" detailing the situation of remaining Chinese residents and a reprint of Territorial Governor Squire\'s call for a return to civil law.'

In the mid-1870s and early 1880s the national economy took a downturn, increasingly leading white workers to view the Chinese as threats to the few available jobs. In 1882 the federal government passed Chinese Exclusion Act, prohibiting all Chinese labor immigration for ten years. By the mid-1880s anti-Chinese sentiment had spread across the West. City leaders in Seattle began to advocate an orderly and legal-supported expulsion of the local Chinese, but not everyone agreed. On February 7, 1886, violence broke out as a mob began to forcibly eject most of the city\'s Chinese population. At least one person was killed when the mob attacked the Home Guards protecting Chinese residents. Martial law was declared and federal troops remained in Seattle until summer. Although the white population of Seattle quickly moved past these events, it would be 20 years for the Chinese population in Seattle to return to its numbers before the riots. The newspaper pictured here, The Seattle Daily Call, was considered radical for its strong support of anti-Chinese issues. The Call was short-lived, appearing only from May 5, 1885 to May 3, 1886, when it was combined with a more reputable paper, The Seattle Daily Chronicle. An article featured in this issue of The Seattle Daily Call titled ""Martial Law"" reports on the continuation of martial law in Seattle, including the printing of general order No. 10 from the Territorial Governor that put in place a curfew. It also reports on the two arrests of the evening, transient men who were released in the morning, prints the wording of general order No. 11, as well as a proclamation from the US President, commanding all disturbers of the peace in Seattle to disperse at peril of their lives.'
