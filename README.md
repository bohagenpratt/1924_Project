# The 1924 Project
## A Python Workflow for Immigration Restriction History
---
**Description & Rationale**
The main purpose of this project is to create a workflow that can serve as a resource for obtaining historical data relating to immigration restrictions in the US. 

2024 marks the 100th anniversary of the creation of the discriminatory national origins quota system. Although the system was replaced after 1965, its legacy and those of earlier exclusionary policies echoes throughout current public discussions of immigration and racialized rhetoric towards migrants. 

To facilitate comparisons between past and present, workflows for extracting datasets of historical documents using Python are described in the project files. Ideally, they provide an additional tool beyond catalog searches to help researchers find resources documenting immigration restrictions.
